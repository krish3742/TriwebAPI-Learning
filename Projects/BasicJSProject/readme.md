## Features

In this project, I have made a Basic JS Project. 

It's working is:
1. There are 4 different boxes of different colors.
2. You can add your text to any of the boxes.
3. Also, you can move the text from one to another after adding the text.
4. You can delete the text anytime.

## Acknowledgements

A big thanks to the TriwebAPI team for helping me in this project.
